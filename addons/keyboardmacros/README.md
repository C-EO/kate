Keyboard Macros Plugin
======================

Record and play keyboard macros (i.e., keyboard action sequences).

## Usage

### Basic use

**To start recording a keyboard macro:**
Menu: `Tools > Keyboard Macros > Record Macroâ€¦`
Default shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+K

The plugin will record every key presses until you end recording.

**To end recording:**
Menu: `Tools > Keyboard Macros > End Macro Recording`
Default shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+K

The plugin will stop recording key presses and save the key presses sequences as the current macro.

**To cancel recording:**
Menu: `Tools > Keyboard Macros > Cancel Macro Recording`

The plugin will stop recording key presses but the current macro won't change.

**To play the current macro:**
Menu: `Tools > Keyboard Macros > Play Macro`
Default shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+K

The plugin will play the current macro.

### Named macros

It is possible to save keyboard macros.

The `kmsave <name>` command will save the current macro under the name `<name>`.

The `kmload <name>` command will load the macro saved under the name `<name>` as the current one.

The `kmremove <name>` command will remove the macro saved under the name `<name>`.

The `kmplay <name>` command will play the macro saved under the name `<name>` without loading it.

Note that after the `km` prefix all these commands use a different letter so you can efficiently use them using tab-completion :).

Named macros are persistent between Kate's sessions, they're saved in the `keyboardmacros.json` file in Kate's user data directory (usually `~/.local/share/kate/`).

## Limitations

As of now, keyboard macros fail to play properly if some types of GUI widgets are used: QMenu, QuickOpenLineEdit, or TabSwitcherTreeView, for example.
I'm not sure why but my first guess would be that it is a combination of these widgets taking time to show up and of the fact that they seem to works differently regarding keyboard events.
